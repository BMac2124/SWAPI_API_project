Star Wars application was paying homage to Star Wars one of my favorite films. 

For this project I used Reactjs to create and render components. 

I also use some of react hooks such as: useEffect, useState.

I also used map() and (props).  

Redux!! was used in the process of this creating this application.  

Future plans are to build on to this project using Bootstrap and maybe pulling more info from the API.
